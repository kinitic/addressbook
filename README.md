Address Book exercise
=====================

##Introduction
The address book application reads an address book in the form of a csv file and has features to:

- return the number of people according to their gender;
- finds the oldest person in the address book
- calculates the range of days between birth dates between 2 randomly selected people.

#### Run tests
Generally I use intellij to run the unit tests but you can also use `mvn clean install`
